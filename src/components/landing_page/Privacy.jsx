        </p>
        <h5>Access, Correction, and Deletion</h5>
        <p>
          If you would like to access, correct, update, or delete your
          information, you can sign in to your SimpleHostel account, navigate to
          your profile, and make the necessary changes. If you are unable to
          make changes through your account, you can reach out to us at
          support@simplehostel.net with your name, email address, and details of
          the information you wish to access, correct, or delete. We will
          respond to your request in a timely manner.

        <p>
          While we are committed to honoring your data rights, we may decline to
          process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require
          disproportionate technical effort (e.g., information located on
          archived or backup systems), jeopardize the privacy of others, or are
          impractical due to technical limitations. We will always aim to
          process requests free of charge unless they are particularly
          burdensome, in which case you will be notified in advance.
